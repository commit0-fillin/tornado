"""Flexible routing implementation.

Tornado routes HTTP requests to appropriate handlers using `Router`
class implementations. The `tornado.web.Application` class is a
`Router` implementation and may be used directly, or the classes in
this module may be used for additional flexibility. The `RuleRouter`
class can match on more criteria than `.Application`, or the `Router`
interface can be subclassed for maximum customization.

`Router` interface extends `~.httputil.HTTPServerConnectionDelegate`
to provide additional routing capabilities. This also means that any
`Router` implementation can be used directly as a ``request_callback``
for `~.httpserver.HTTPServer` constructor.

`Router` subclass must implement a ``find_handler`` method to provide
a suitable `~.httputil.HTTPMessageDelegate` instance to handle the
request:

.. code-block:: python

    class CustomRouter(Router):
        def find_handler(self, request, **kwargs):
            # some routing logic providing a suitable HTTPMessageDelegate instance
            return MessageDelegate(request.connection)

    class MessageDelegate(HTTPMessageDelegate):
        def __init__(self, connection):
            self.connection = connection

        def finish(self):
            self.connection.write_headers(
                ResponseStartLine("HTTP/1.1", 200, "OK"),
                HTTPHeaders({"Content-Length": "2"}),
                b"OK")
            self.connection.finish()

    router = CustomRouter()
    server = HTTPServer(router)

The main responsibility of `Router` implementation is to provide a
mapping from a request to `~.httputil.HTTPMessageDelegate` instance
that will handle this request. In the example above we can see that
routing is possible even without instantiating an `~.web.Application`.

For routing to `~.web.RequestHandler` implementations we need an
`~.web.Application` instance. `~.web.Application.get_handler_delegate`
provides a convenient way to create `~.httputil.HTTPMessageDelegate`
for a given request and `~.web.RequestHandler`.

Here is a simple example of how we can we route to
`~.web.RequestHandler` subclasses by HTTP method:

.. code-block:: python

    resources = {}

    class GetResource(RequestHandler):
        def get(self, path):
            if path not in resources:
                raise HTTPError(404)

            self.finish(resources[path])

    class PostResource(RequestHandler):
        def post(self, path):
            resources[path] = self.request.body

    class HTTPMethodRouter(Router):
        def __init__(self, app):
            self.app = app

        def find_handler(self, request, **kwargs):
            handler = GetResource if request.method == "GET" else PostResource
            return self.app.get_handler_delegate(request, handler, path_args=[request.path])

    router = HTTPMethodRouter(Application())
    server = HTTPServer(router)

`ReversibleRouter` interface adds the ability to distinguish between
the routes and reverse them to the original urls using route's name
and additional arguments. `~.web.Application` is itself an
implementation of `ReversibleRouter` class.

`RuleRouter` and `ReversibleRuleRouter` are implementations of
`Router` and `ReversibleRouter` interfaces and can be used for
creating rule-based routing configurations.

Rules are instances of `Rule` class. They contain a `Matcher`, which
provides the logic for determining whether the rule is a match for a
particular request and a target, which can be one of the following.

1) An instance of `~.httputil.HTTPServerConnectionDelegate`:

.. code-block:: python

    router = RuleRouter([
        Rule(PathMatches("/handler"), ConnectionDelegate()),
        # ... more rules
    ])

    class ConnectionDelegate(HTTPServerConnectionDelegate):
        def start_request(self, server_conn, request_conn):
            return MessageDelegate(request_conn)

2) A callable accepting a single argument of `~.httputil.HTTPServerRequest` type:

.. code-block:: python

    router = RuleRouter([
        Rule(PathMatches("/callable"), request_callable)
    ])

    def request_callable(request):
        request.write(b"HTTP/1.1 200 OK\\r\\nContent-Length: 2\\r\\n\\r\\nOK")
        request.finish()

3) Another `Router` instance:

.. code-block:: python

    router = RuleRouter([
        Rule(PathMatches("/router.*"), CustomRouter())
    ])

Of course a nested `RuleRouter` or a `~.web.Application` is allowed:

.. code-block:: python

    router = RuleRouter([
        Rule(HostMatches("example.com"), RuleRouter([
            Rule(PathMatches("/app1/.*"), Application([(r"/app1/handler", Handler)])),
        ]))
    ])

    server = HTTPServer(router)

In the example below `RuleRouter` is used to route between applications:

.. code-block:: python

    app1 = Application([
        (r"/app1/handler", Handler1),
        # other handlers ...
    ])

    app2 = Application([
        (r"/app2/handler", Handler2),
        # other handlers ...
    ])

    router = RuleRouter([
        Rule(PathMatches("/app1.*"), app1),
        Rule(PathMatches("/app2.*"), app2)
    ])

    server = HTTPServer(router)

For more information on application-level routing see docs for `~.web.Application`.
