"""An I/O event loop for non-blocking sockets.

In Tornado 6.0, `.IOLoop` is a wrapper around the `asyncio` event loop, with a
slightly different interface. The `.IOLoop` interface is now provided primarily
for backwards compatibility; new code should generally use the `asyncio` event

    Most applications should not attempt to construct an `IOLoop` directly,
    and instead initialize the `asyncio` event loop and use `IOLoop.current()`.
    In some cases, such as in test frameworks when initializing an `IOLoop`
    to be run in a secondary thread, it may be appropriate to construct
    an `IOLoop` with ``IOLoop(make_current=False)``.

    In general, an `IOLoop` cannot survive a fork or be shared across processes
    in any way. When multiple processes are being used, each process should
    create its own `IOLoop`, which also implies that any objects which depend on
    the `IOLoop` (such as `.AsyncHTTPClient`) must also be created in the child
    processes. As a guideline, anything that starts processes (including the
    `tornado.process` and `multiprocessing` modules) should do so as early as
    possible, ideally the first thing the application does after loading its
    configuration, and *before* any calls to `.IOLoop.start` or `asyncio.run`.

    .. versionchanged:: 4.2
       Added the ``make_current`` keyword argument to the `IOLoop`
       constructor.

       ``make_current=True`` is now the default when creating an IOLoop -
